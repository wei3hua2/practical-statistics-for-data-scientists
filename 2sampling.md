# 2. Data and Sampling Distribution

## Random Sampling and Sample Bias

_sample_ - a subset of data from a larger data set (population).   
_population_ - the larger data set or idea of a data set.   
_N(n)_ - The size of the population (sample).   
_Random sampling_ - Drawing elements into a sample at random.   
_Stratified sampling_ - Dividing the population into strata and randomly sampling from each strata.   
_Simple random sample_ - The sample that results from random sampling without stratifying the population.   
_Sample bias_ - A sample that misrepresents the population.   

Data quality (data science) = completeness, consistency of format, cleaniness, accuracy of individual data points.   
Statistics adds the notion of representativeness.

Size vs Quality: When Does Size Matter?

Sample Mean versus Population Mean

## Selection Bias

_Bias_ - Systematic error.   
_Data snooping_   
_Vast search effect_   

Regression to the mean

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

_Sample Statistic_   
_Data distribution_   
_Sampling distribution_   
_Central limit theorem_   
_Standard error_   

## The Bootstrap

_Bootstrap sample_   
_Resampling_   

## Confidence Intervals

_Confidence Level_   
_Interval endpoints_   

For data scientist - to communicate the potential error in an estimate, and, perhaps, learn whether a larger sample is needed.

## Normal Distribution

_Error_   
_Standardize_   
_z-score_   
_Standard normal_   
_QQ-Plot_   

## Long-Tailed Distribution

_Tail_   
_Skew_   

Black swan theory - asuming a normal distribution can lead to underestimation of extreme events.

## Student's Distribution

distribution of sample statistics.

normally shaped, but a bit thicker and longer on the tails.

_n_   
_Degrees of freedom_   

## Binomial Distribution

_Trial_   
_Success_   
_Binomial_   
_Binomial trial_   
_Binomial distribution_   

## Poisson and Related Distribution

_Lambda_   
_Poisson distribution_   
_Exponential distribution_   
_Weibull distribution_
