## Hypothesis Testing

To learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect. It was invented as a way to protect researchers from being fooled by random chance.

_Null hypothesis_   
_Alternative hypothesis_   
_One-way test_   
_Two-way test_   

## Resampling

_Permutation test_   
_with or without replacement_   

## Statistical Significance and P-Values

If result is beyond the realm of chance variation, it is said to be statistically significant.

_P-value_   
_Alpha_   
_Type 1 error_   
_Type 2 error_   

for data scientist, a p-value is a useful metric in situations where you want to know whether a model result that appears interesting and useful is within the range of normal chance variability.

A feature might be included in or excluded from a model depending on its p-value.

## t-Tests

_Test statistic_   
_t-statistic_   
_t-distribution_   

## Multiple Test

_Type 1 error_   
_False discovery rate_   
_Adjustment of p-values_   
_Overfitting_   

## Degree of Freedoms

_n or sample size_   
_d.f._   

## ANOVA

analysis of variance. statistical procedure that tests for a statistically significant difference among groups.

_Pairwise comparison_   
_Omnibus test_   
_Decomposition of variance_   
_F-statistic_   
_SS_   

## Chi Square

Used with count data to test how well it fits some expected distribution.

_Chi-square statistic_   
_Expectation or expected_   
_d.f._   

One data application is in determining appropriate sample sizes for web experiments.

Used more as a filter to determine whether an effect or feature is worthy of further consideration than as a formal test of significance.
